# Posenet model
Posenet (Skeleton Detection, Human Pose Estimation) models in tf.js format

# Why
Based on https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/pull/879, the https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/weights/posenet/mobilenet_v1_101/manifest.json is 404 now, need a place to store these model files (JSON + binaries).

# Note
We can also track https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet to get latest model files, maybe there are new versions.
